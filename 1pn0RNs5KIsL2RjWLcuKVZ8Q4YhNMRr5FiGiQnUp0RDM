The FFF youth in Greater Sudbury are non-partisan and they need your help. They encouraging youth and FFF supporters to get to the June 7 rally downtown to bring a non-partisan climate voice to the Power of Many Rally. Please remind people that- cancelling the previous governments plans and fighting the federal plan in the courts is costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars- Ontario's climate plan is twice as expensive as the federal plan and is costing taxpayers because federal plan gives the money back to the people and most households would come out ahead - especially the poor and middle class (one of our strikers has been lobbying for carbon pricing since she was seven years old and she has listened carefully to the experts) - we support all levels of government declaring climate emergencies.-Three of our  FFF youth in Sudbury in October  2018 watched the climate emergency debates for the 1.5C IPCC  report live in the House of Commons. They want all adults to work together and follow expert advice.- mostly, be non-partisan about the climate crisis If FFF supporters could bring these messages to this rally on Friday, that would be really appreciated. We are in this together.|Today, while our grade 6 contingent enjoys their last day of school, the older youth and adult helpers are meeting to continue organizing for the our big FFF rally on September 26. All are welcome to join. Remember youth are to lead the way and adults are helpers.|We are hoping to recruit many people of all ages to help us make sure Greater Sudbury's FFF rallies on September 20 and September 27 are memorable. Please note that the main group of youth that have been striking since November are 12 and under and thus an adult is the contact person.|We are in the midst of planning for Sept 20-27 every Friday in July.

Our educational trips for students and young professionals make them learn about critical environmental issues and they contribute to create solutions across Africa. We welcome everyone to join and share their actions working together to increase examples of well-managed sustainable tourism and environmental conservation to uplift Africans out of poverty and instill them a sense of purpose and pride.","Organization that you represent (optional)":"Red Rocks Rwanda|Red Rocks Initiatives for Sustainable

Latin American activists, including Colombian activists are responsible for protecting the Amazon rainforest from deforestation. The Amazon, the largest rainforest in the world, is an enormous carbon sink, and is vital in the fight for climate justice. Join us for a non-violent peace strike in solidarity with Colombian environmental activists. Everyone is needed, regardless of age.|Note- though this is a youth focused strike, adult allies are always welcome to and encouraged to join. We will be striking in support of the National Climate Emergency Declaration Resolution, and will demand that Senator Feinstein, Rep. Doris Matsui and Rep. Ami Bera sign onto the resolution. The first step to solving the climate crisis is acknowledging the issue, and we demand that our elected officials do so! The strike will include speeches by local youth climate leaders, chants, and an optional die-in.","Organization that you represent (optional)":"Fridays For Future Sacramento","2019-03-17-People":300,"2019-05-26-People":70,"2019-06-23-People":0,"2019-08-11-People":0,"2019-09-22-People":0},{"Country":"USA","Town":"Sacramento Valley Station,  I St, Sacramento","Address":"In front of townhall","Time":"At 12.00-13.00 (noon to 1pm)","Date":"2019-05-09","Frequency":"Every Friday","Event Type":"Strike","Lat":"38.5841616","Lon":"-121.5006754","2019-05-12-People":0,"2019-05-19-People":0,"2019-05-26-People":0,"2019-06-02-People":0,"2019-06-09-People":0,"2019-06-16-People":0,"2019-06-23-People":0,"2019-06-30-People":0,"2019-07-07-People":0,"2019-07-14-People":0,"2019-07-21-People":0,"2019-07-28-People":0,"2019-08-04-People":0,"2019-08-11-People":0,"2019-08-18-People":0,"2019-08-25-People":0,"2019-09-01-People":0,"2019-09-08-People":0,"2019-09-15-People":0,"2019-09-22-People":0,"2019-09-29-People":0,"2019-10-06-People":0,"2019-10-13-People":0,"2019-10-20-People":0,"2019-10-27-People":0,"2019-11-03-People":0,"2019-11-10-People":0,"2019-11-17-People":0,"2019-11-24-People":0,"2019-12-01-People":0},{"Country":"USA","Town":"Salem","Address":"In front of the capitol building","Time":"10-12pm","Date":"2019-03-15|2019-03-26|2019-05-24","Frequency":"Every Friday","Link to event (URL), e.g. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, web":"https://ffforegon.wordpress.com/|https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx2vyuFJv6h/?igshid=vqx3kvailar1","Event Type":"Strike","Lat":"42.51954|44.9428975","Lon":"-70.8967155|-123.0350963","Your name":"Casey Brooks","Email Address":"schoolstrike4climate.oregon@gmail.com","Notes (optional)":"Instragram handle is @f4f.or","Organization that you represent (optional)":"FridaysForFuture.Oregon","2019-03-17-People":30,"2019-03-31-People":0,"2019-04-07-People":0,"2019-04-14-People":0,"2019-04-21-People":0,"2019-04-28-People":0,"2019-05-05-People":0,"2019-05-12-People":0,"2019-05-19-People":0,"2019-05-26-People":120,"2019-06-02-People":0,"2019-06-09-People":0,"2019-06-16-People":0,"2019-06-23-People":0,"2019-06-30-People":0,"2019-07-07-People":0,"2019-07-14-People":0,"2019-07-21-People":0,"2019-07-28-People":0,"2019-08-04-People":0,"2019-08-11-People":0,"2019-08-18-People":0,"2019-08-25-People":0,"2019-09-01-People":0,"2019-09-08-People":0,"2019-09-15-People":0,"2019-09-22-People":0,"2019-09-29-People":0,"2019-10-06-People":0,"2019-10-13-People":0,"2019-10-20-People":0,"2019-10-27-People":0,"2019-11-03-People":0,"2019-11-10-People":0,"2019-11-17-People":0,"2019-11-24-People":0,"2019-12-01-People":0},{"Country":"USA","Town":"Salisbury","Address":"Ward Museum of Wildfowl Art, Salisbury University, 909 S.
