as a species have caused mass destruction, and thus far have acted as a virus to the earth, simply using resources until either the host (earth) or the virus (us) dies. We cannot carry on in this way, as Greta said, our metaphorical house is on fire, nobody wants to hear this, and the few that do in politics seem to only want to for their own political gain and popularity, yet we should fight on never the less. They push us down yet we will fight back, not with violence, but in civil unrest, we shall not pacify ourselves and be docile and obedient to the mouthpieces that sign our deathwarrant, revolution does not come from following the rules, and the rules are the very things choking us anyways. When we are burning, drowning, and choking on ash, they will listen, but until they can see their children physically caughing up blood in hellfire they wont, unless we do all we can to pre warn and change their minds, even if unsuccessful, we must try. They don't deserve our help, but they need it as we need theirs. "},{"Country":"UK","Town":"Stroud","Address":"Wallbridge Lock, Stroud.
